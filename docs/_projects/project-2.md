title: "Distributions of stress in wildlife populations"
excerpt: "Animals rely not only on external information when making decisions, but also on internal information about their current state. Can stress levels, as a proxy for internal state, inform our understanding of animal risk perception and decision-making? By considering differences in population distributions of stress levels, I seek to connect patterns of stress with models of decision-making."
