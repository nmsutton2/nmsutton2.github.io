title: "Predator-prey games"
excerpt: "Viewing predator-prey interactions from a game-theoretic lens afford an opportunity to explore a number of questions surrounding predator-prey interactions. Of interest to me are the decision mechanisms and dynamics of prey selection, predator pursuit/capture, and at a higher level, food-web formation."
