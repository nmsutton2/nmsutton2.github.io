Howdy! I am a Post-doctoral research associate at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I am broadly interested in all questions regarding decision-making in animal behavior. In particular, I am interested in how information encoded in the environment is gathered, shared, and otherwise used to inform individual decision-making, and consequently how decisions made at the individual level may shape higher-order processes and interactions.

I believe in taking an integrative approach to research, leveraging methods and data from multiple different sources to answer questions. Currently, I am focused on combining theoretical modeling frameworks with empirical data gathered in the field and in a laboratory setting to answer questions regarding risk perception and decision-making during predator-prey interactions. For a more detailed description of my current research projects, please see the "Projects" page above. For publications and information on my teaching experience, please visit the "CV" page. Thanks for stopping by!
